# Atlantic-SuperStore
The Atlantic Superstore dashboard which i created in Tableau provides a comprehensive overview of the company's sales and profitability, along with insights into customer behavior across different regions.

The dashboard starts with a summary of the company's total sales and profit, giving the viewer an immediate understanding of the financial health of the business. Using the action filter on region, the viewer can see how these metrics vary across different geographic areas, allowing for targeted analysis and decision-making.

The dashboard also highlights the most profitable products, which can be a useful tool for identifying areas for growth or improvement. The viewer can drill down into specific categories and subcategories to get a more detailed understanding of product performance.

The top 10 and bottom 10 cities by sales provide further insights into regional variations in customer behavior. This information can be used to target marketing efforts, optimize supply chain management, and better understand customer preferences.

Finally, the dashboard includes a breakdown of new vs existing customers, which can be a valuable metric for tracking customer acquisition and retention. By understanding the behaviors and preferences of different customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to maximize growth and profitability.

Overall, the Atlantic Superstore dashboard you created in Tableau provides a comprehensive and interactive view of the company's sales, profitability, and customer behavior, allowing for targeted analysis and informed decision-making.
